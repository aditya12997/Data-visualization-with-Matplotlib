# Data-visualization-with-Matplotlib

In this notebook I have showcased how different methods can be used to demonstrate different information about the datasets with Matplotlib and why such visualizations can be useful. 


## 1. Football Pass Network Map 
With the help of MPL soccer library and Pandas I was able to manipulate the data and extract meaningful insights about Barcelona style of Play.
Here I cleaned the data by removing the null values and only considered values from the start until the first susbtitution was made. 
This passing network depicts the playing style of Barcelona and how do they manage they ball possession in different positions.

I have used two interesting datasets of gas prices in different countries and FIFA dataset.

With the help of these datasets I could implement my knowledge of Matplotlib and Pandas where I could demonstrate different type of visuals and the analysis of data one can do with these visuals. 

# 2. With Gas prices:
I looked into what countries has the most expensive gas price as per USD and one can also have a specific view to their preferred countries and see the trend lines to analyse the different scenarios.

# 3. With the FiFa dataset because I'm a football fanatic:
I looked into the number of players and their skill level with a a histogram as it gives me an idea as to how many players are there in that distribution. 

There could be different analysis that can be done here, I have also looked into the players preferred foot as that could be analysed with the dataset.

### Moreover: 
Footballers tend to be very athletic that also means light-weight which can give us an ideal range as to how many pounds to they weigh and that might determine their positon in a way. Like strong players at the defence, and light players that are quick in the attacking position. 

### Finally
I also looked into the Club ranking of the top 3 clubs with a box plot, this can helps us give a significant ranking of the clubs based on their performances over the years.
