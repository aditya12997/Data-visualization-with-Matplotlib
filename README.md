# Data-visualization-with-Matplotlib

In this notebook I have showcased how different methods can be used to demonstrate different information about the datasets with Matplotlib and why such visualizations can be useful. 

I have used two interesting datasets of gas prices in different countries and FIFA dataset.

With the help of these datasets I could implement my knowledge of Matplotlib and Pandas where I could demonstrate different type of visuals and the analysis of data one can do with these visuals. 

# With Gas prices:
I looked into what countries has the most expensive gas price as per USD and one can also have a specific view to their preferred countries and see the trend lines to analyse the different scenarios. 


# With the FiFa dataset because I'm a football fanatic:
I looked into the number of players and their skill level with a a histogram as it gives me an idea as to how many players are there in that distribution. 

There could be different analysis that can be done here, I have also looked into the players preferred foot as that could be analysed with the dataset. 

### Moreover: 
Footballers tend to be very athletic that also means light-weight which can give us an ideal range as to how many pounds to they weigh and that might determine their positon in a way. Like strong players at the defence, and light players that are quick in the attacking position. 

### Finally
I also looked into the Club ranking of the top 3 clubs with a box plot, this can helps us give a significant ranking of the clubs based on their performances over the years.
